<ul>
	<li>Each Face</a></li>	
		<li>All Shirts</a></li>
		<li>Faker's Name Box</a></li>
		<li>Coach Box</a></li>
		<li>SK Telecom Box</a></li>
		
	</ul>
	<p>Faker is the most popular player on SKT T1's roster. I chose faker's box because he is the team leader and is very well known. He is also the only player with his own twitch stream. I chose the faces to link to the about page for each player.</p>
	
	<p>I chose the coach box for the team twitch stream because he oversees everything. The coach is responsible for running the team's twitch stream. He is also responsible for scheduling all games while not in season. </p>
	
	<p>I chose the shirts because those shirts are popular among fans. I myself have bought several shirts from that website. I chose the SK Telecom T1 Box to linke to where the team games can be watched. Lolesports is where all official games can be found for any proffessional League of Legends team.</p>
